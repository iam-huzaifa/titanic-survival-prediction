# Titanic Survival Prediction Project 🚢

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic shipwreck based on the passenger’s information such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset is from the famous [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) challenge on Kaggle. It includes features like:

- PassengerId
- Pclass (ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of boarding)

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Loads and analyzes the Titanic dataset
- Handles missing data
- Converts categorical features into numeric form
- Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or others)
- Evaluates the model's accuracy
- Makes survival predictions on new data

## 📦 Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `titanic_survival_prediction_project.ipynb`
2. Run each cell step by step
3. You can modify features and try different models

## 🎯 Goal

To practice basic machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on a real-world dataset.
